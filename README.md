Created as part of an assessment for The University of Lincoln.
Requires Android 5.1 (Lollipop) and up.

An AR game where Sir Isaac Newton asks the player to embark on an exploratory mission 
around the Isaac Newtown Building to find apples was chosen as the concept for this project. 
These apples are AR game objects which are hidden until a user scans a real-world marker, and 
then places the apples found into an inventory style system as a form of collectible.
